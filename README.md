# Disable Compliance Notification

This mod disables Compliance Notification for South Korean users.

## What is Compliance Notification?

As there's some Korean Gaming Laws, Game should notify play time to user each hour if it's online(able) game.\
Bedrock edition already implemented this with Xbox Notification(All platform except Playstation) and Playstation
Console-wide Notification.\
As of 1.18.2, Mojang decided to implemented this on Java Edition with own implementation.
